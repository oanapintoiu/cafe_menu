## Features

### üé® Background and Font Styling

- **Background Image**: A picture of coffee beans is set as the background for a cozy feel. This is done with `background-image` and `background-size: cover`, which ensures the image covers the whole screen.
- **Font Styling**: A clean and readable font is chosen for normal text and a bold, impactful font for headings. This is done with `font-family: sans-serif` and `font-family: Impact, serif`.

### üìè Responsive Design

- **Container Sizing**: The menu adjusts to fit the screen size. It‚Äôs set to take up 80% of the screen width but not more than 500 pixels wide, thanks to `width: 80%` and `max-width: 500px`. This ensures it looks good on both small and large screens.
- **Padding and Margins**: Space is added around and inside the menu using `padding` and `margin` so everything doesn‚Äôt feel too cramped.

### üéØ Alignment and Layout

- **Center Alignment**: The text and images are centered on the page. This is achieved with `text-align: center` for text and `margin: auto` for images and containers.
- **Inline-Block Layout**: For the menu items, `display: inline-block` is used, which makes the prices line up nicely next to the item names.

### üåà Color Scheme and Icons

- **Color Palette**: Soft background colors with darker text colors are used to make everything easy to read.
- **Icons**: Little icons are added next to the coffee and dessert sections to make the menu more fun and easy to understand. This is done with `<img>` tags and setting their sizes.
